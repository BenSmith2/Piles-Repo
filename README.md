# Piles-Repo
New Project Management like system
first project
Created a working back end 9/22/22
tested in MySql and ran queries so far working 
my next step is to build out that routes and crud features
last will be aesthetics and user experience/polish.
My main focus on this is to build upon the skills I learned in school,
and just take everything up another notch or two. 
I dont have a deadline but would like to have a chunk done by the end of the month.
I want to have this done enough to have a link on my resume and something working just to show current skill level.
Please leave any suggestions! somehow... i dont know how you would. Maybe message me or something. idk man you figure it out.
